<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>The Great Beauty</h3>
<p>An homage to rome. Beautiful photography. A movie about life.</p>

<h3>Cinema Paradiso</h3>
<p>A movie about love and friendship. The people we love the most can sometimes hurt us thinking it's for our own good.</p>

<h3>Poor Things</h3>
<p>A crazy story about coming of age, female pleasure, innocence and love.</p>
